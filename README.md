## 🔐 Security & Access Control

- **Spring Security** with **JWT**
- Users authenticated with:
  - Email & password
  - Token returned on login
- Role-based access using `@PreAuthorize`:
  - `ROLE_ADMIN` — full access
  - `ROLE_DOCTOR` — read-only own data
  - `ROLE_PATIENT` — view self only
- Token added to all requests:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

## 🌐 Web Frontend (Optional)

### `index.html` Features
- Patient form to add name, age, gender, email, phone
- JavaScript fetch API to call backend
- View list of patients after submission
- Simple Bootstrap design

📁 File path: `/src/main/resources/static/index.html`

## 📄 PDF + Email: How It Works

1. Admin generates bill
2. `PdfGenerator` creates the PDF using iText
3. `EmailService` sends email to patient with PDF attached
4. Frontend/Swagger/postman confirms with `200 OK`

# 3. Set MySQL DB in application.properties
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_pass

# 4. Add your email + app password
spring.mail.username=your_email
spring.mail.password=your_app_password

# 5. Run the app
mvn clean install

## 📫 Future Extensions

- React-based Admin Dashboard
- Patient profile page + QR Code
- Payment gateway integration
- Bill download history + database email logs

---

## 🧠 Best Practices Followed

- Clean separation of layers (Entity, Service, Controller)
- Secure endpoint exposure
- DTOs over raw entities (for frontend)
- No Lombok: Manual getters/setters for transparency
- `@JsonManagedReference` & `@JsonIgnore` to handle JSON loops
- Cascading relationships handled carefully
- Secure email via TLS
- Minimal frontend but functional
